## 1. Introduction
This SRS defines requirements for ViSignAR, a mobile app that converts live Vietnamese speech into Vietnamese Sign Language (VSL) 3D animation output.

### 1.1 Document Purpose
This SRS defines concrete, testable requirements for product, engineering, and QA so that any team can implement ViSignAR consistently using ViroReact AR (ARKit/ARCore) and Expo.

### 1.2 Product Scope
ViSignAR supports one direction only: live Vietnamese speech -> VSL 3D sign animation.  
ViSignAR does not include typed text input, reverse translation, account systems, or non-core modules.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

| Term | Definition |

### 1.5 Document Overview
Section 2 defines product boundaries. Section 3 defines implementation requirements. Section 4 defines verification criteria. Section 5 provides dictionary and animation specification appendixes.

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Product Perspective
ViSignAR is a mobile translation app with deterministic speech-to-sign conversion and AR-based sign clip rendering via ViroReact (ARKit on iOS, ARCore on Android). Sign clips are pre-rendered VSL reference videos anchored in front of the user in 3D space, preserving the AR property of the product without requiring a fully rigged 3D avatar pipeline.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- Capture live Vietnamese speech.
- Transcribe speech to Vietnamese text using STT API.
- Normalize and tokenize transcript deterministically.
- Resolve tokens/phrases into sign IDs via dictionary.
- Play an ordered VSL sign sequence in an AR scene anchored in front of the user.
- Show clear status for success and unknown terms.

### 2.3 Product Constraints
- UI colors must be exactly `#000000`, `#FFFFFF`, `#013392`.
- Input channel is live speech only.
- Translation engine is deterministic dictionary mapping.
- Stack is minimal: Expo + React Native app shell, ViroReact AR module (ARKit/ARCore), OpenAI STT API.

### 2.4 User Characteristics
- Primary user: Vietnamese speaker requiring VSL visual output.
- Interaction style: short speech sessions with single-tap controls.
- Technical profile: non-technical end user.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Device microphone is available.
- Device network is available for STT API.
- Dictionary and AR sign clips are prepared according to Appendix C and D.
- ARKit (iOS) / ARCore (Android) is available on the deployment device; on devices without ARCore support, the AR scene degrades gracefully (camera passthrough disabled, clip still plays on a 2D plane).
